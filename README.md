# Prior Setting In Practice: Strategies and rationales used inchoosing prior distributions for Bayesian analysis


This github repository contains supplementary materials for the CHI 2020 submission, *Prior Setting In Practice: Strategies and rationales used inchoosing prior distributions for Bayesian analysis*

This repository is intended for use by reviewers of the paper only.

The repository is structured as follows: 
- The folder labelled *Survey* contains materials used in the survey (which had three separate conditions). Within the *Survey* folder, the folders labelled `Condition 1 - Parameter scale density vis`, `Condition 2 - Response scale density vis`, `Condition 3 - Prior predictive density vis` contain the first two pages of the survey for the conditions Parameter scale density visualization, Response scale density visualization and Prior predictive density visualization respectively. The page 3 of the survey, which asks participants some open-ended questions is within the *Survey* folder.

- The folder labelled data analysis contains the two R scripts detailing our exploratory analysis of the data, and our calculation of predictive probability mass (depcited in Figures 4 and 5). It also contains the deidentified responses to our survey.

- The folder labeled *user-study-html* contains the materials used during the follow-up interviews.

- The folder labelled *Transcripts* contain the transcripts from the follow-up interviews.

- The semi-structured interview protocol we used for our follow up interviews can be found in the root directory.
