# Prior Setting In Practice: Strategies and rationales used inchoosing prior distributions for Bayesian analysis


This github repository contains supplementary materials for the CHI 2020 submission, *Prior Setting In Practice: Strategies and rationales used inchoosing prior distributions for Bayesian analysis*

This repository is intended for use by reviewers of the paper only.

The repository is structured as follows: 
- The directory labelled *Survey* contains materials used in the survey. The survey had three separate conditions, the materials for them can be found in separate directories within the *Survey* directory:
	- [Condition 1 - Parameter scale density vis](https://github.com/abhsarma/interactive-prior-setting/tree/master/Survey/Condition_1_Parameter_scale_density_vis) contain the first two pages for the `Parameter scale density visualization` condition. They survey can be viewed online <a href="https://abhsarma.github.io/interactive-prior-setting/Survey/Condition_1_Parameter_scale_density_vis/0c-user-study-1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
	- [Condition 2 - Response scale density vis](https://github.com/abhsarma/interactive-prior-setting/tree/master/Survey/Condition_2_Response_scale_density_vis)  contain the first two pages for the `Response scale density visualization` condition. They survey can be viewed online <a href="https://abhsarma.github.io/interactive-prior-setting/Survey/Condition_2_Response_scale_density_vis/1t-user-study-1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
	- [Condition 3 - Prior predictive density vis](https://github.com/abhsarma/interactive-prior-setting/tree/master/Survey/Condition_3_Prior_predictive_density_vis)  contain the first two pages for the `Prior predictive density visualization` condition. They survey can be viewed online <a href="https://abhsarma.github.io/interactive-prior-setting/Survey/Condition_3_Prior_predictive_density_vis/2t-user-study-1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
	- The [page 3](https://abhsarma.github.io/interactive-prior-setting/Survey/survey-pg3.pdf) of the survey, which asks participants some open-ended questions can also be found within the *Survey* directory.

- The directory labelled data analysis contains the two R scripts detailing our <a href="https://abhsarma.github.io/interactive-prior-setting/data-analysis/data-analysis.html" target="_blank">analysis of the data</a>, and our <a href="https://abhsarma.github.io/interactive-prior-setting/data-analysis/probability-mass-analysis.html" target="_blank">calculation of predictive probability mass</a> (depcited in Figures 4 and 5). It also contains the deidentified responses to our survey.

- The directory labeled *user-study-html* contains the materials used during the follow-up interviews. Although this was different for each interviewee, an example can be found <a href="https://abhsarma.github.io/interactive-prior-setting/user-study-html/1t-user-study.html" target="_blank">here</a>. This document is for a participant who was in *Condition 2 - Response scale density vis* in the survey.

- The directory labelled *[Transcripts](https://github.com/abhsarma/interactive-prior-setting/tree/master/Transcripts)* contain the transcripts from the follow-up interviews.

- The <a href="https://abhsarma.github.io/interactive-prior-setting/Semi-structured%20Interview%20protocol.pdf" target="_blank">semi-structured interview protocol</a> we used for our follow up interviews can be found in the root directory.
